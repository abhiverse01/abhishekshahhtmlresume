Trained a Llama-2 7B model on a custom code/description pairs dataset collected through GitHub Scraping. Successfully demonstrated easy Python code generation using Natural language descriptions during College Majors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Hand-Gesture Recognizer:</strong> Building a project that uses OpenCV and a CNN model to convert hand gestures into their respective sign language codes. It can be an effective tool for handicapped people to communicate effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sentiment Analyzer:</strong> Successfully built a sentiment analyzer using the Distilbert-Base model to classify the sentiment of a statement as whether positive or negative. The model achieved a notable accuracy of 89 percent in sentiment analysis tasks for text classification.</li>

                    <li>Working on my very own GitHub repo titled "how-I-learned-python" and "how-I-learned-ml", to be put out as a one-stop guide and an effective resource for anyone trying to start learning Python, ML and Deep Learning Concepts.</li>
                    <li>I even volunteered and managed the Deltathon which is a hackathon conducted every year by ACES in Eastern Regional Campus, TU.</li>
                    <li>After my time as a Volunteer, I even took part in the Deltathon the next year with my team, we were called team "ZAV". I learned a lot through competitive coding and exposure to greatly experienced individuals.</li>
                    <li>I love trying to put out the ideas in my mind to physical shape, whether it be through code, sketches, rough drawings, idea-logs that I make etc.</li>
